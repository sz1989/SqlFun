# Happy New Year, all, 

# I am writing to provide an update regarding Andyâ€™s issue in the UAT last Thursday. I tried to replicate the issue in the DEV but was unable to reproduce it. 

# After closely re-analyzing the code that is responsible for the Loss Monthly closing process this morning, and I will make another attempt to create a situation in DEV that might reproduce the issue. I will keep everyone informed about my progress as I continue to work on this.

# Thank you for your attention to this matter.

# Best regards.
